Add Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView from Nuget prerelese package


Using MicroCharts.Forms Plugin
=========================
Add MicroCharts.Forms[SkiaSharp dll] from Nuget prerelease package

Changed the Generic Chartview Control to specific Chart Control in XAML . Because the Generic ChartView control is not recognized in Microcharts nmespace for the XAML.
That still has some unknown issue so,
Replace ChartView to Chart as Generic Control
Actuall issue is that i installed microchart instead of microchart.forms plugin

Add the plugin common to the solution, there is a separate call should be made in each platform for the plugin in Main Activity(Android or other)
